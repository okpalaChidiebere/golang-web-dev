on windows you can install telnet
on Mac, should be there but if not, you can install it from Hoebrew using "brew install temnet"

start main.go (go run main.go), a pop up in you commputer will tell you to give permission to allow connection to the tcp server you started, then go to another terminal window and enter this:
telnet localhost 8080

telnet used for port testing
